            <p>My name is John D. Pham. I have over 10 years of professional experience in New York City's nonprofit sector. I am passionate about the potential for web development to help nonprofit and public services get delivered more efficiently, effectively, and equitably. I created this website to share my learning journey. Ride along with me as I learn about web development and how I can use it for the greater good. Welcome aboard!</p>
