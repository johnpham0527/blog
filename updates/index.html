            <h3>First Project Uploaded: Choropleth Map - Data Visualization</h3>
            <p class="date">Posted April 5, 2020</p>
            <p>I have <a href="../projects/choropleth.html">uploaded my first project</a>: a choropleth map of educational attainment in the United States. 
              This data visualization uses a color spectrum to show how educational attainment differs by county.</p>
            <h4>What I Learned</h4>
            <p>As a nonprofit professional who conducts a lot of research for grant proposals, I am already familiar with reading choropleth maps.
              Creating one, however, was a challenge. I used <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a> to learn about the JavaScript D3.js data visualization library.
              For this particular project, I used a second library called TopoJSON to read in the topological data (i.e., the data that is used to draw the lines, arcs, and shapes for each county).
              I then used D3.js to read the educational attainment data and output the map, colors, and legend.</p>
            <p>To successfully complete this project, I needed to learn how to fetch both the educational attainment and the topological data, which are located in different URLs.
              To do this, I learned and implement JavaScript's Promise.all function. I also learned about this useful data visualization resource called <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org">Color Brewer</a>, which helped me to pick the color scheme.
              I also implemented a hash lookup to speed up the tooltip performance. Finally, I became very familiar with the browser debugging in order to render the tooltip and legend correctly.</p>
            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <p>The grant writing that I do in my current full-time job focuses on Queens County.
              I would like to leverage what I've learned from this project to create various choropleth maps of American Community Survey data for Queens's various neighborhoods.
            I look forward to creating and posting these projects in the future.</p>
